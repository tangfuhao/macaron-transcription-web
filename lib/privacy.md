# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 01, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how Macaron – Transcription (“the App”, “we”, “us”) handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding how your information is processed.

## About the App

Macaron – Transcription is a speech-to-text utility tool that allows users to record audio and convert it into text. All processing is designed with privacy and user control in mind.

## Data We Collect
2.1 Audio Input Provided by Users

When you use the App to record or upload audio, the audio data is used solely for the purpose of generating text transcription.

## No Personal Information Automatically Collected

The App does not automatically collect any personal information, device identifiers, analytics data, advertising data, or background usage statistics.

## How Your Data Is Processed
###  Local Processing

All audio files and transcription results are stored locally on your device. They remain under your full control and are never uploaded to our own servers.

### Cloud Processing via Deepgram

If you enable transcription through cloud processing, the App sends your audio data directly to Deepgram, a third-party speech-to-text service provider.

Audio is transmitted securely via encrypted HTTPS (TLS).

Data is used only for generating transcription.

We do not retain, store, or have access to the audio or transcription data.

Data is not used to train AI models unless explicitly permitted by Deepgram’s own policies.

## Data Storage and Retention

We do not operate any servers and do not store any user data outside your device.

All audio recordings and transcription results remain on your device until you manually delete them.

Once audio is sent to Deepgram for processing, the App does not keep any copy other than the one stored locally on your device.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or distribute any user data to any third party except:

Deepgram, solely for real-time speech transcription when you choose to use cloud-based transcription.

We do not integrate any third-party advertising SDKs, analytics tools, user tracking systems, or social login services.

## Permissions Used
Microphone Permission

Required to record audio for transcription.
The App does not access the microphone unless you actively initiate a recording.

Local Storage

Used only to save audio files and transcription results on your device.

No other permissions are used.

## Security

We follow industry-standard practices to protect your data:

Data transmitted to Deepgram is encrypted (HTTPS/TLS).

No user data is stored outside your device.

We do not collect or store passwords, personal identifiers, or account information.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is not intended for children under the age of 13.
We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children.

## Your Rights

Since the App does not collect or store personal data on servers, you maintain full control:

You can delete audio files and transcription results at any time from within the App or via your device’s file manager.

You may uninstall the App at any time, which will remove all locally stored data.
